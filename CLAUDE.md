# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository State

This is a newly initialized repository named "poetry" with minimal content:
- Contains only a basic README.md file
- Has a .gitignore file configured for Java/Maven projects
- No source code or project configuration files present yet

## Project Context

The repository name suggests this may be intended for a Python Poetry project, though the current .gitignore contains Java/Maven patterns. The project direction should be clarified before development begins.

## Development Setup

No build system, dependencies, or development commands are currently configured. Future development will require:
- Determining the actual project language and framework
- Setting up appropriate project configuration files (e.g., pyproject.toml for Python Poetry, or pom.xml for Maven)
- Updating .gitignore to match the chosen technology stack
- Adding appropriate build, test, and development scripts

## Next Steps

This repository needs initial project setup before meaningful development can begin. Consider:
1. Clarifying the project's intended purpose and technology stack
2. Initializing the project with appropriate configuration files
3. Setting up a proper development workflow with build and test commands
